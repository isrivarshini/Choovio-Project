### Install

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mainflux/mainflux.git
cd mainflux
```
Install Node modules:
```bash
npm install
```

Run Gulp Task:
```bash
gulp
```

### Docker
Apart from main `nodejs` Docker image, Mainflux also uses `mongo` Docker image (database instance is run in a separte generic Docker image).

This is why Mainflux uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), to run both `nodejs` and `mongo` images at the same time and make a connection between them:
```bash
    docker-compose up
```
